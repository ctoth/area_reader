A nomad camp~
    This small group of desert nomads has stopped for the day to rest
and refresh themselves beside this beautiful oasis. Three tents and some
camels make up the party. From within two of the tents you hear muffled
voices, obviously surprised at your visit.

Inside a small tent~
    This is a small and simple tent with few possessions in sight. Lying
here and there are young-looking men and women, possibly slaves to the
leader of this band.

the ground. To the east you see a small tent while to the north you see a
larger, fancier tent.

The warrior's tent.~
     This tent has a few furnishings, but mainly it holds the band's
protectors. They all stare at you coldly as you enter.

The main tent~
     This tent is as lavishly decorated on the inside as it is on the
outside. A fancy carpet lies on the sand and numerous baskets line the
walls.

The main tent~
     This is where the leader of this band of nomads resides. He is
definitely rich as you inspect the tapestries, baskets, and a few
paintings as well.

Strange Glowing Sand~
A vast desert stretches for miles, the sand constantly shifting around you.
But this patch of desert looks different ... the sand glows.  You see a
futuristic city to the south.

The wind-swept ledge~
    Being very careful not to lose your balance, you look around and
find that this canyon is about a half a kilometer deep. To the west is
a dark cave leading under the desert sands.

The mysterious lair.~
    You have stumbled upon the home of something. From the treasure
haphazardly strewn about and the rotting carcasses, you would guess that
this is a dragon's lair. As to what type, you can't really say. The cave
narrows out into a tunnel to the west.
