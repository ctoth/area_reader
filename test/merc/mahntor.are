The dark woods~
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.

by the carnage here when you enter the clearing. There appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were dragged off in two 
directions, south and east.

You enter a large ring of boulders. Sheltered by this wall of stones, a small
cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

north, south, and west.

The stench is overwhelming. You can hardly breathe as you enter the cave.
Looking around, you realize that some bizarre and horrible creature uses this
cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.

life here. It is possible to climb down to the shore here. The hills
themselves are to the north. The edge of the hills leads to the east along the

a bit to keep your balance. The salty sea air fills your nostrils and you
notice signs of life in the rocky crags here. You can climb down towards the
shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are
standing leads east and west along the shoreline.

The rocky shore~
You stand at the base of some rocky hills, where they meet a rocky shore. A
vast sea is to your south. Looking to the southwest, you see a small altar
that glows with a eerie blue light. The shore stretches out to the south and
west. It is possible to climb up into the hills here.

The edge of the sea~

you look out across it. You notice a small altar that glows with blue light
to the east. The shore itself extends north away from the water's edge.

The Blood Sea Portal~
You stand on a small pedestal like altar that has been built on the shore here.
Standing here, you can look out across the sea. You can almost imagine that
you see a far away island. Dominating the altar is a small blue portal of
light. It is possible to walk south into the portal. The shore itself extends
to the north, east, and west.
There are small inscriptions on the rock at the base of the portal.

The edge of the sea~
You walk along the water's edge. The tide appears to have risen. Very little
debris is washed up on shore. You slip and slide as you tread across the
slippery rocks that make up the shore. To the west you see a small altar that
radiates blue light. The shore extends north away from the water's edge.

You seem to be floating in blue weightlessness. You tumble head over heels and
finally right yourself. Gaining your bearings, you notice that there are two
"windows" in the sea of blue here. One to the south shows an image of a snowy
plain. Another window the the north shows an image of a rocky shore.

The swampy path~
This damp path seems to lead into a deep, dark swamp. The trees above block
out all light and stifle the wind. You smell swamp gas and hear damp squashing
sounds all around you. The path leads east deeper into the swamp. You also see

carefully picking your way around obstacles. Large, gnarled trees rise above
you. Their moss covered branches block out all traces of the sun. The path
