Troll's Larder~
This room has blood and grime all over the walls.  You see maggots and other
insects crawling up them.  The resident is definitely uncivilized.  Half-eaten
and rotting body parts scatter the floor, each having its own colony of flies,
worms, and maggots.

You welcome the fresh breeze coming from the east, but wrinkle your nose when

The Playpen~
The walls are covered with blood (and body parts!?!?).  Plastered on the far
wall you see what looks like a human arm.  A half-eaten body lies here with
its chest ripped out.  The predator seems disinterested in it.

This reminds you of what a baby would do to its formula during dinnertime,
plastering it on the wall.

#2805
Troll's Bedroom~
Obviously something REALLY big lives here.  The stench is quite unbearable.
There are piles and piles of rotten and half-eaten body parts of animals,
orcs, (and humans?) strewn across the floor.  There is a larger, more
prominent pile of rotten parts over in a corner.  It seems to have been
flattened by something.
